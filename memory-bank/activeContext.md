# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on establishing the foundational documentation for the website improvement project, including project brief, product context, and the memory bank structure. The next immediate step is to conduct detailed research on the tech stack and create a `researchstack.md` document, followed by a `design.md` document.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` with initial project goals and scope.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md` outlining the problems the project solves and UX goals.

## Next Steps
1. Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
2. Create `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
3. Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
4. Create `designs` directory.
5. Create Web Design Bank files (`designBrief.md`, `brandContext.md`, `styleGuide.md`, `layoutPatterns.md`, `componentLibrary.md`, `progress.md`) within the `designs` directory.
6. Conduct detailed research on the current tech stack and create `researchstack.md`.
7. Create `design.md` with a detailed design plan.
8. Begin code updates and design enhancements based on the research and design plans.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project is a frontend website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- Emphasis on "best level, updated code and all, max design and good looking real a lot" implies a need for modern UI/UX, performance, and accessibility.
- Need to ensure server-side vs. client-side considerations are strictly followed, as per user instructions.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to `.clinerules` for all operations.
- Use of MCP tools for research and other tasks where applicable.
- Detailed documentation and knowledge capture in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project currently lacks foundational documentation, which is being addressed.
- The user has a strong emphasis on design quality and up-to-date technology.
