# Project Brief

## Project Name
Website Improvement

## Project Goal
To improve the existing website to the "best level," incorporating updated code, maximum design, and an overall good-looking aesthetic. This includes enhancing UI/UX, updating the tech stack, and ensuring modern best practices are followed.

## Core Requirements
- **Updated Codebase:** Migrate to the latest stable versions of all frameworks and libraries (React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, etc.).
- **Enhanced Design & UI/UX:** Implement a modern, visually appealing design. This involves reviewing and potentially overhauling existing components, layouts, and styling.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improve loading times, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the website adheres to WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
- **Maintainability:** Refactor code for better readability, modularity, and ease of future development.
- **Security:** Implement best practices for web security.

## Target Audience
(To be determined - will require further analysis of the existing website's purpose)

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Improved Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- User engagement metrics (e.g., reduced bounce rate, increased time on site)
- Positive feedback on design and usability

## Project Scope
- Review and update existing React components.
- Refactor CSS using Tailwind CSS best practices.
- Implement new UI elements and design patterns.
- Optimize assets (images, fonts).
- Ensure responsive design across various devices.
- Conduct a thorough code review for quality and maintainability.
- Research and document the updated tech stack.
- Create a detailed design plan.

## Out of Scope
- Major new feature development (unless directly contributing to "improvement" goals).
- Backend development (focus is on the frontend website).

## Success Criteria
- The website is visually appealing and modern.
- The codebase is updated and follows current best practices.
- Performance metrics show significant improvement.
- The website is accessible to a wide range of users.
- User feedback is overwhelmingly positive regarding the improvements.
