# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The website is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, utilizing Vite as a build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. It follows a component-based architecture, where UI elements are broken down into reusable React components.

    Components --> Pages[Pages (Home, Projects, Contact, etc.)]
    Pages --> UI[UI Components (Button, ProjectCard, etc.)]
    Pages --> Layout[Layout Components (Navbar, Footer)]
    SPA --> StateManagement[Context API (ThemeContext)]
    SPA --> Data[Local Data (projects.ts, skills.ts)]
    SPA --> Styling[Tailwind CSS]
    SPA --> BuildTool[Vite]
    SPA --> Language[TypeScript]
```

## Key Technical Decisions (Current)
- **Frontend Framework:** React for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS, enabling rapid UI development.
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality.
- **State Management:** React Context API for global state (e.g., ThemeContext).
- **Routing:** (To be determined - likely React Router, needs verification from code)
- **Component Organization:** Components are organized by feature (e.g., `src/components/Home/`) and by type (e.g., `src/components/UI/`).

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable UI components.
- **Container/Presentational Components:** (Likely, needs verification) Separation of concerns between logic and UI.
- **Context API:** For managing global state like themes.

## Component Relationships
- **Pages:** Compose various components to form complete views (e.g., `Home.tsx` uses `HeroSection`, `AboutSection`, `FeaturedProjects`, `TeamSection`).
- **Layout Components:** (`Navbar`, `Footer`) provide consistent structure across pages.
- **UI Components:** (`Button`, `ProjectCard`, `SectionHeading`, `SkillCard`) are atomic, reusable elements used across different features.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **Routing:** How navigation between pages is handled.
- **Data Flow:** How data is passed down to components and how state changes are managed.
- **Styling Integration:** How Tailwind CSS is integrated and used consistently.
- **Responsiveness:** How the UI adapts to different screen sizes.

## Areas for Improvement (Architectural)
- **State Management:** For more complex applications, a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit) might be beneficial.
- **Performance:** Further optimization of component rendering, lazy loading, and asset delivery.
- **Code Splitting:** Implementing code splitting at the route level to reduce initial bundle size.
- **Error Boundaries:** Implementing React Error Boundaries for graceful error handling in UI.
- **Testing Strategy:** Formalizing unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
