# Tech Context

## Technologies Used (Current)
- **Frontend Framework:** React (version to be determined from `package.json`)
- **Build Tool:** Vite (version to be determined from `package.json`)
- **Styling Framework:** Tailwind CSS (version to be determined from `package.json`)
- **Language:** TypeScript (version to be determined from `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`)
- **Package Manager:** npm (based on `package.json` and `package-lock.json`)
- **Linting:** ESLint (based on `eslint.config.js`)
- **PostCSS:** (based on `postcss.config.js`)

## Development Setup
- Node.js environment
- npm for package management
- Vite for local development server and build process

## Technical Constraints
- Frontend-only application.
- Data is currently local (`src/data/`). If dynamic content is needed, an API integration would be a future consideration.
- No explicit backend or database mentioned in the current file structure.

## Dependencies (from `package.json` - to be verified)
- react
- react-dom
- @types/react
- @types/react-dom
- typescript
- vite
- tailwindcss
- postcss
- autoprefixer
- eslint
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
- @typescript-eslint/parser
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- eslint-plugin-react-hooks
- eslint-plugin-react-refresh

## Tool Usage Patterns
- `npm install` for dependency management.
- `npm run dev` for local development.
- `npm run build` for production builds.
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- TypeScript for type checking during development.

## Areas for Improvement (Technical)
- **Dependency Updates:** Ensure all packages are updated to their latest stable versions to leverage new features, performance improvements, and security fixes.
- **Build Process Optimization:** Further fine-tune Vite configuration for smaller bundle sizes and faster builds (e.g., aggressive tree-shaking, image optimization plugins).
- **Code Quality Tools:** Integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting, and potentially more rigorous linting rules.
- **Testing Frameworks:** Introduce Jest/React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, and Cypress/Playwright for E2E tests.
- **Routing Library:** Explicitly define and potentially update the routing library (e.g., React Router DOM).
- **Environment Variables:** Proper management of environment variables for different deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.
