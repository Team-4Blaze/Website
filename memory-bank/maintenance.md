## Adding New Content

### Adding a New Team Member
1. Add the team member's information to `src/data/team.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "unique-id",
     name: "Team Member Name",
     role: "Team Member Role",
     subtitle: "Short description",
     bio: "Detailed biography...",
     image: "/path/to/image.jpg",
     social: {
       github: "https://github.com/username",
       linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/username",
       telegram: "https://t.me/username",
     },
     skills: ["Skill 1", "Skill 2", "Skill 3"],
   }
   ```
2. Add the team member's image to the `public/assets/team/` directory.
3. The team member will automatically appear in the Team page.

### Adding a New Project
1. Add the project's information to `src/data/projects.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "unique-id",
     title: "Project Title",
     description: "Project description...",
     tags: ["Tag 1", "Tag 2", "Tag 3"],
     image: "/path/to/image.jpg",
     githubLink: "https://github.com/team-4blaze/project",
     liveLink: "https://project-demo-url.com",
     featured: true, // Set to true to show in the featured section
   }
   ```
2. Add the project's image to the `public/assets/projects/` directory.
3. The project will automatically appear in the Projects page and Featured Projects section if `featured` is true.

### Adding a New Skill
1. Add the skill to `src/data/skills.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     name: "Skill Name",
     icon: "icon-name", // Corresponding icon from Lucide
     category: "language" // One of: language, framework, aiml, tool
   }
   ```
2. The skill will automatically appear in the Skills page under the appropriate category.

## Making Design Changes

### Colors
1. Update the color definitions in `tailwind.config.js` to change the color palette.
2. Color classes follow the pattern: `bg-primary-500`, `text-secondary-400`, etc.

### Typography
1. Update the font family definitions in `tailwind.config.js`.
2. Font size, weight, and line height classes follow the Tailwind CSS conventions.

### Component Styles
1. Component-specific styles are contained within each component file.
2. Global styles are in `src/index.css`.
3. Use Tailwind utility classes when possible for consistency.

## Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment
1. Make changes to the codebase.
2. Commit and push to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

### Manual Deployment
1. Build the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
3. These files can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Deployment Failures
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific errors.
2. Verify that all dependencies install correctly with `npm ci`.
3. Ensure the build process completes successfully with `npm run build`.
4. Check for TypeScript errors with `tsc --noEmit`.

### Styling Inconsistencies
1. Ensure Tailwind classes are being properly processed.
2. Check for conflicting styles in global CSS.
3. Verify that dark mode classes are applied correctly.

### Routing Issues
1. Verify that HashRouter is being used for GitHub Pages.
2. Check for incorrect routes in navigation components.
3. Ensure 404.html is correctly configured for redirects.

### Component Errors
1. Check console for specific error messages.
2. Verify props are being passed correctly to components.
3. Check for missing dependencies in useEffect hooks.
