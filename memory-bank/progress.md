# Progress

## Current Status
- **Documentation Setup:** Initial core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created.
- **Project Understanding:** Basic understanding of the website's current architecture (React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript) and the user's high-level goals for improvement.

## What's Left to Build
- **Memory Bank:**
    - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this file) needs to be updated with ongoing progress.
- **Web Design Bank:**
    - Create `designs` directory.
    - Create `designs/designBrief.md`.
    - Create `designs/brandContext.md`.
    - Create `designs/styleGuide.md`.
    - Create `designs/layoutPatterns.md`.
    - Create `designs/componentLibrary.md`.
    - Create `designs/progress.md`.
- **Research & Design Documents:**
    - Create `researchstack.md` (detailed tech stack research).
    - Create `design.md` (detailed design plan).
- **Code Implementation:**
    - Update dependencies to latest stable versions.
    - Refactor existing components for modern practices and improved design.
    - Implement new UI/UX elements.
    - Optimize performance and accessibility.
    - Implement a robust testing strategy.

## Known Issues
- Specific versions of current dependencies are not yet determined.
- The exact scope of "max design and good looking real a lot" needs to be translated into concrete design decisions.
- No explicit routing library identified yet, which is crucial for a SPA.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to prioritize documentation setup to ensure clear context and adherence to `.clinerules`.
- Emphasis on research and design planning before significant code changes.

## Version History of Major Progress
- **2025-05-31:** Initial Memory Bank setup.
