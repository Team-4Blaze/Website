# Product Context

## Why this project exists
The existing website needs significant improvement to meet modern standards for design, performance, and user experience. The goal is to transform it into a "best-level" website that is visually appealing, highly functional, and easy to maintain.

## Problems it solves
- **Outdated Aesthetics:** The current design may appear old or unappealing, impacting user perception and brand image.
- **Poor User Experience:** Navigation, responsiveness, or interaction flows might be suboptimal, leading to user frustration and high bounce rates.
- **Technical Debt:** The codebase might be using older versions of libraries/frameworks, leading to security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and difficulty in adding new features.
- **Performance Issues:** Slow loading times or unoptimized assets can deter users and negatively impact SEO.
- **Accessibility Gaps:** The website might not be accessible to users with disabilities, limiting its reach and potentially leading to compliance issues.
- **Maintainability Challenges:** Disorganized or poorly documented code can make future updates and bug fixes time-consuming and error-prone.

## How it should work
The improved website should:
- Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- Load quickly and perform smoothly across various devices and network conditions.
- Present information clearly and engagingly.
- Be easy to navigate and interact with.
- Be robust and free of critical bugs.
- Be built on a modern, maintainable, and scalable tech stack.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should easily find the information they need.
- **Engaging Visuals:** The design should be modern, clean, and visually appealing to capture and retain user attention.
- **Fast Interactions:** All interactions (clicks, form submissions) should feel responsive.
- **Consistent Experience:** The design and functionality should be consistent across all pages and components.
- **Inclusive Design:** The website should be usable by individuals with diverse abilities.
