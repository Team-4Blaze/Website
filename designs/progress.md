# Design Progress

## Current Design Status
- **Design Bank Setup:** All core Web Design Bank files (`designBrief.md`, `brandContext.md`, `styleGuide.md`, `layoutPatterns.md`, `componentLibrary.md`) have been created.
- **Initial Design Principles:** Established foundational guidelines for typography, color, spacing, layout, and component design.
- **Accessibility Focus:** Integrated accessibility notes and considerations into the style guide and component library.

## Completed Modules
- Initial documentation for core design elements.

## Pending Tasks
- **Refine Design Brief:** Based on a deeper understanding of the existing website's content and purpose.
- **Develop User Personas:** Create `userPersona.md` if needed, to inform design decisions.
- **Wireframes/Sketches:** Create `wireframes.md` to visualize new layouts and component placements.
- **Inspiration Examples:** Curate `inspirationExamples.md` to guide the aesthetic direction.
- **Accessibility Checklist:** Create `accessibilityChecklist.md` for a more detailed audit.
- **Apply Design to Code:** Translate the established design principles and component specifications into actual code changes.
- **Iterative Design Review:** Continuously review and refine the design based on implementation and potential user feedback.

## Blockers
- Lack of specific content and functionality details of the existing website to tailor the design precisely. This will require reviewing the existing React components and data files.

## Next Milestones
1. Review existing website code to understand current features, content, and routing.
2. Refine `designs/designBrief.md` and `memory-bank/productContext.md` with specific website details.
3. Begin detailed research on the tech stack to create `researchstack.md`.
4. Develop a comprehensive `design.md` document that synthesizes all design bank information into an actionable plan.

## Version History of Major Design Revisions
- **2025-05-31:** Initial Web Design Bank setup with foundational design principles.
